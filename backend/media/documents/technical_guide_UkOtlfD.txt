A Guide to Natural Language Processing with Python

Introduction to NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, particularly how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Getting Started with NLP in Python
Python offers several powerful libraries for NLP tasks. In this guide, we'll focus on spaCy, one of the most efficient libraries for production use.

1. Installation
To install spaCy, run:
```
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

2. Basic Text Processing
```python
import spacy

# Load English language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Process text
text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
doc = nlp(text)

# Tokenization
for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
```

3. Named Entity Recognition
```python
# Extract entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

4. Part-of-Speech Tagging
spaCy automatically assigns part-of-speech tags to each token in the document.

5. Dependency Parsing
Dependency parsing is the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence.
